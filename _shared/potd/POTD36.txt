The Problem

    Write a program that reads a file called text.txt line by line and prints out all of the lines that have the string "purple" in them
    In a text file called testcases.txt, write
        three differnt testcases (what the contents of text.txt would look like)
        why you chose those test cases, and what you would expect the outputs to be
        Then alter the contents of text.txt to see if your program produces the expected output for your test cases
