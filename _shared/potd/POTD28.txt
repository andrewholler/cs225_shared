The Problem

Look at the new node struct provided for you. This represents a node in a binary tree. Write a mehtod smoosh that accepts a node * (the root of a binary tree) and returns nothing. The method should transform a binary tree into a linked list in the following manner:

Binary tree:
     1
    / \
   2   5
  / \   \
 3   4   6

Linked list:
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
