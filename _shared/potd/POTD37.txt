The Problem

    Write a program that takes a positive integer x from stdin and either prints if x is prime, or if it is not prime, prints out the numbers less than x that evenly divide x
        You can assume that the input will be an integer
    Create a text file called testcases.txt and in it write
        3 inputs
        what you expect the output to be
        and why you chose them

Sample inputs and outputs:

Input: 5

Output: 5 is prime

Input: 6

Output: 1 2 3 divide 6
