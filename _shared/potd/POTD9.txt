Consider the given file q9.cpp, which has the following code:

int main(){
    int ** a = new int *[2];
    int b = 3;
    a[0] = &b;
    a[1] = new int;
    *(a[1]) = 5;
    int ** c = new int *;
    *c = new int;
    int *** d = &c;

    return 0;
}

Write code to free up the memory used. Be sure to set all pointers on the stack to point to NULL when they are no longer pointing to valid memory.
