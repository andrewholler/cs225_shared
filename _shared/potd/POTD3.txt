CS225 Daily Exercise

You will be writing an pet class with the following variables:

    name
    birth_year
    type (e.g., dog, cat, platypus)
    owner_name

and functions that allow you to access and set each of these variables. Make sure the names match up. For example, the birth_year variable should have getter get_birth_year and setter set_birth_year. In a comment, explain why you chose to make variables and functions private or public.
