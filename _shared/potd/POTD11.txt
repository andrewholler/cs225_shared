CS225 Daily Exercise

    Write a student class that has two private member variables: name and grade (e.g., 6, 11).
    Write the functions to access those private member variables. Write the default constructor.
    Write the function graduate that is not part of the class which increases the grade of a student by one. This function should be called by passing a student object by reference.
    Write a main method that creates an instance of the student class, prints out the grade, calls graduate on it, and prints out the new grade.

Sample output:

Sally is in grade 5.
Sally is in grade 6.
