The Problem

Write a method intersection that takes in two node * (the heads of two linked lists) as parameters and returns a node * (the head of a new list). The returned list should be a new dynmically allocated linked list that has the values in the set intersection (no duplicates) of the two lists in sorted order.

Example:

List 1: 5 9 0 3 0
List 2: 3 5 6 7 0 0
Returned list: 0 3

Something about writing a main method and test cases... oh that's right, you should be writing a main method with your own test cases!
