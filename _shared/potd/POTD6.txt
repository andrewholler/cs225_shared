Write a program that does the following:

    Creates an integer x on the stack with value 2016
    Prints out the address of x and the value of x
    Creates an integer pointer p on the HEAP
    Assigns the pointer to point to x
    Changes the value of x to 2017 via p
    Prints out the address of x and its value using only p.
    Make sure that your program has no memory leaks.

Sample Output:

x is stored at address 0x7fff55a88a38 and has value 2016
x is stored at address 0x7fff55a88a38 and has value 201
