The Problem

    Write a square class that has two member variables:
        a double * length
        a string name
    Write a default constructor that assigns name to be "mysquare" and assign length to point to a double on the heap with value 2.0
    Write the copy constructor and destructor for the square class
        Have the copy constructor print out the line "I am copying!"
    Write a main function that by doing two different things, causes the line "I am copying!" to be printed
