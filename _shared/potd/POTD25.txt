The Problem

Write a sortList method that accepts a node ** (the head of a linked list) as a parameter and returns nothing. It should sort the list passed in as a parameter and return a pointer to the sorted list's head. You may NOT call new. You need to rearrange the nodes that have already been allocated.

You should be doing this at this point without prompting, but just in case: write a main method with test cases to see if your function works properly in all scenarios!
