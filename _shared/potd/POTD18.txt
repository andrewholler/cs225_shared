The Problem

    Write a templated class BankAccount
        It should have a private member balance
        It should have public functions
            getBalance
            add (accepts an amount, adds it to balance, returns nothing)
            remove (accepts an amount, subtracts it from balance, returns nothing)
            a constructor that takes in the initial balance as a parameter
    Write a main function with two bank accounts
        The first bank account should be able to store dollars and change
        The second bank account is at a bank that refuses to accept change, so the amounts involved in transactions will only be integers
        Each account should start with a $2000 balance
        Add .50 to the first bank account and remove .50 from the second
