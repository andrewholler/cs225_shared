The Problem

    Write a program that prompts the user to enter a word and then convert that string to pig latin
    Here is how you should convert a string to pig latin:
        If the word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y), tack "ay" onto the end of the word
        If the word starts with a consonant (anything else), remove the consonants up to the first vowel, tack the consonants onto the end of the word, add "ay" onto the end of the word
        If there are no vowels in the inputed word, just tack "ay" onto the end of the word
    If the string is "q", your program should exit
    You program should keep prompting and accepting strings until "q" is entered

Sample input/output:

input: east output: eastay

input: n output: nay

input: west output: estway
