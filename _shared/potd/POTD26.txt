The Problem

Write a method shuffle that takes in two node * (the heads of two linked lists) as parameters and returns a node * (the head of a new list). The returned list should be the interleaving of the two lists, starting with the first list. For example:

List 1: 0 2 4
List 2: 1 3 5
Returned list: 0 1 2 3 4 5

List 1: 0 2
List 3: 1 3 3 4
Returned list: 0 1 2 3 3 4

You may NOT call new. You need to rearrange the nodes that have already been allocated.

Remeber to write a main method with test cases!
