The Problem

Create a class Stack. The stack should be implemented with a dynamically allocated linked list (you may want to make a listnode struct/class within Stack).

Implement the following member functions of the stack class - int size() - returns the number of elements in the stack (0 if empty) - bool isEmpty() - returns if the list has no elements, else false - void push(int val) - pushes an item to the stack in O(1) time - int pop() - removes an item off the stack and returns the value in O(1) time - You should also implement the constructor which accepts no arguments and creates an empty stack, and a destructor for the class.
