The Problem

Write a method printList that accepts a node * (the head of the list) as a parameter and returns nothing. The method should print out the list in the following format:

Example list: 1 2 3

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 3

If the list is empty then the function should print "Empty list"

You can (and should) write a main method to test your funciton.
