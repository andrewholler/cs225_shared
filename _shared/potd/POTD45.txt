The Problem

Write a main method in q45.cpp that passes the correct parameters into functions 1--6 so that they print the following:

Hail to the Orange.

Hail to the Blue.

Hail Alma Mater,

Ever so true.

We love no other,

So let our motto be

Victory, Illinois, Varsity.

Do NOT change the functions themselves.
